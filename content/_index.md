Hello, I'm Matt, I've been writing code and managing teams for almost 20 years.

 
I've moved on from day to day coding in favour of management and strategy. Trying (and sometimes failing) to improve the lives of technologists' whilst delivering what the business needs - results.

 
I still like to stay up-to-date but these days that mainly consists of POC projects, low code explorations (it is the future), infrastructure automation, and more recently ML.
